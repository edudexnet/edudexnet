What is EduDex?

EduDex is an academic search engine currently being developed by a team of students from various universities and technical institutes.

Our mission is to create a platform that provides researchers, scientists, and students with access to high-quality academic content. 
Unlike other search engines, EduDex will focus exclusively on indexing academic institutions, including hundreds of top universities around the world. 
Additionally, we will also index whitelist-approved organizations, ensuring that users access only relevant and trusted sources.

Our goal is to offer a clean, distraction-free search environment, allowing users to concentrate on their research without the interference of ads or irrelevant content. 
With EduDex, we aim to make the wealth of knowledge housed in universities and academic institutions around the world more accessible, while maintaining the integrity of the information.

This is a tool built by students and the free software community (open source), for students and researchers, with a commitment to supporting academic excellence. 
We welcome and appreciate any support or networking opportunities that can help us grow and ensure that EduDex becomes available to the academic community as soon as possible.
